A Go Library for Vend
========

This is not a standalone app, but a library to work in conjunction with other apps, like:
- [Vend CLI](https://github.com/vend/vend-cli)
- [Sales Ledger export tool](https://github.com/jackharrisonsherlock/vend-sales-export)

Please use the above as an example of how to use the library.

DISCLAIMER:
This is by no means endorsed by Vend, and is a library built for Vend's experimental 2.x API so should be used with caution.
